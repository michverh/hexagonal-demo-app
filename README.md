# This is a demo app to showcase Hexagonal Architecture

### The application core was deliberately kept clean of any framework or library outside of Lombok, to really highlight the architecture itself and it's lack of reliance on frameworks.

#### Note: This is just one possible way of implementing it, in different projects it might make sense to make different decisions.
#### Unit Tests and Integration/Infrastructure Tests are not implemented in this project as this is meant to demo specific parts, but they are crucial in a real project.
